4. Coverage and Completeness of Calabi–Yau Datasets
Background. Large databases of Calabi–Yau manifolds have been constructed using specific
geometric frameworks, such as complete intersections in products of projective spaces and hy
persurfaces in toric varieties. Canonical examples include the Complete Intersection Calabi–Yau
(CICY) threefolds and the Kreuzer–Skarke classification of reflexive polytopes. These datasets play
a central role in algebraic geometry, string theory, and related areas.

Problem Description. The central problem is to determine whether existing datasets ade
quately represent the space of Calabi–Yau manifolds within their respective construction classes.
More broadly, one would like to understand whether substantial families of Calabi–Yau geome
tries are missing, rare, or systematically underrepresented due to limitations of the construction
methods.
Current Status. Within their defining frameworks, major datasets such as the CICY threefolds
and the Kreuzer–Skarke list are complete and rigorously classified. However, the relationship
between these datasets and the full space of Calabi–Yau manifolds remains unclear.
What AI Can Do. AI methods can analyze dataset structure to identify gaps, redundancies,
sparsity patterns, and clustering phenomena, and suggest candidate constructions or geometric
transitions extending beyond known datasets.
