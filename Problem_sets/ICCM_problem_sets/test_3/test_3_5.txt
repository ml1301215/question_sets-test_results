5.  Prediction and Explanation of Topological Invariants
Background. Topological invariants such as Hodge numbers, Euler characteristics, and inter
section data encode essential geometric information about Calabi–Yau manifolds, yet are often
expensive to compute from first principles.
Problem Description. The challenge is to predict such invariants efficiently from simpler com
binatorial or algebraic data, and to understand which structural features genuinely control their
values.
Current Status. Invariant computation is typically construction-dependent and computationally
intensive, with no general explanatory theory connecting discrete data to global invariants.
What AI Can Do. AI models can act as fast surrogate predictors and, through interpretability
techniques, help identify meaningful geometric features and failure regimes that guide theoretical
understanding.
