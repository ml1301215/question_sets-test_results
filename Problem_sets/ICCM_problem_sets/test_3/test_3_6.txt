6. Conjecture Mining from Structured Mathematical Data
Background. Modern mathematics increasingly produces large, structured datasets of mathematical objects and associated invariants.
Problem Description. The problem is to extract robust patterns from such data and to formulate precise, falsifiable conjectures that remain stable under dataset extension.
Current Status. There is currently no systematic pipeline for converting data-driven patterns into rigorous mathematical conjectures.
What AI Can Do. AI systems can detect stable correlations, propose compact conjectural statements, and actively search for counterexamples, functioning as hypothesis generators alongside human reasoning.
