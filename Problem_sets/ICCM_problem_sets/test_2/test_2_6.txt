Problem 6. Consider the Bernoulli percolation on an infinite d-regular (d ∈ N and d ≥ 3) tree T with root o. More precisely, T is an infinite tree where each vertex has d neighbors. Each edge is open with probability p, and closed with probability 1 − p, independently of the states of other edges. Let C(o) be the connected component (called cluster) containing o, i.e., C(o) is the subset of all vertices that can be reached from o through open edges. Let θ(p) be the probability that o is in an infinite cluster, i.e., θ(p) = P(|C(o)| = ∞).
1. Prove that there exists a p_c ∈ (0,1) such that if p > p_c, then θ(p) > 0, while if p < p_c, then θ(p) = 0. Give the value of p_c.
2. Fix any p ∈ (0, p_c), prove that there exist constants c, C > 0 (which may depend on p_c but do not depend on k) such that for all k ≥ 2, P(|C(o)| ≥ k) ≤ C exp(−c k).
