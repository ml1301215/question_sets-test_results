Fix a finite group $G$. Let $\mathcal{O}$ denote an incomplete transfer system associated to an $N_{\infty}$ operad. Define the slice filtration on the $G$-equivariant stable category adapted to $\mathcal{O}$ and state and prove a characterization of the $\mathcal{O}$-slice connectivity of a connective $G$-spectrum in terms of the geometric fixed points.
