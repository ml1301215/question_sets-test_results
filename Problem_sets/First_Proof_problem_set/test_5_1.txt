Let $\mathbb{T}^3$ be the three-dimensional unit size torus and let $\mu$ be the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on the space of distributions $\mathscr{D}'(\mathbb{T}^3)$. Let $\psi: \mathbb{T}^3 \to \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function that is not identically zero and let $T_{\psi}: \mathscr{D}'(\mathbb{T}^3) \to \mathscr{D}'(\mathbb{T}^3)$ be the shift map given by $T_{\psi}(u) = u + \psi$ (with the usual identification of smooth functions as distributions). Are the measures $\mu$ and $T_{\psi}^{*}\mu$ equivalent? Here, equivalence of measures is in the sense of having the same null sets and $T_{\psi}^{*}$ denotes the pushforward under $T_{\psi}$.
