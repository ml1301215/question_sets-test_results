For a graph $G = (V, E)$, let $G_S = (V, E(S,S))$ denote the graph with the same vertex set, but only the edges between vertices in $S$. Let $L$ be the Laplacian matrix of $G$ and let $L_S$ be the Laplacian of $G_S$. I say that a set of vertices $S$ is $\epsilon$-light if the matrix $\epsilon L - L_S$ is positive semidefinite. Does there exist a constant $c > 0$ so that for every graph $G$ and every $\epsilon$ between $0$ and $1$, $V$ contains an $\epsilon$-light subset $S$ of size at least $c\epsilon |V|$?
