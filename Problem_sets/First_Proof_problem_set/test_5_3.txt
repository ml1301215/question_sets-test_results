Let $\lambda = (\lambda_1 > \cdots > \lambda_n \geq 0)$ be a partition with distinct parts. Assume moreover that $\lambda$ is restricted, in the sense that it has a unique part of size $0$ and no part of size $1$. Does there exist a nontrivial Markov chain on $S_n(\lambda)$ whose stationary distribution is given by
\[
\frac{F^{*}_{\mu}(x_1,\dots,x_n; q=1, t)}{P^{*}_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n; q=1, t)} \quad \text{for } \mu \in S_n(\lambda),
\]
where $F^{*}_{\mu}(x_1,\dots,x_n; q, t)$ and $P^{*}_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n; q, t)$ are the interpolation ASEP polynomial and interpolation Macdonald polynomial, respectively? If so, prove that the Markov chain you construct has the desired stationary distribution. By ``nontrivial'' we mean that the transition probabilities of the Markov chain should not be described using the polynomials $F^{*}_{\mu}(x_1,\dots,x_n; q, t)$.
